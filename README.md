## Overview

This application was made to provide accurate real time weather data based on users search criteria for cities. 

## How-It-Works

The page will always load with the City of Orlando as the default. User must provide a city to search for within the search box. The user will be returned with weather data regarding the city they searched. This includes the cities current tempature, feels like tempertaure, humidity, wind speed and UV index. User is presented with the current dates data in a big card at the top followed by a 5 day forecase in smaller cards below. Each card also has an image to represent the weather. The history of each city searched will be saved and listed below the search bar. User can click the city from history to request real time data again.

## Test

You can test this application by entering data into the search bar and clicking the search icon. Then go to the console.log(s) to view any errors or the locally saved data. There are also console.log(s) setup throughout the JavaScript code for testing purposes.
